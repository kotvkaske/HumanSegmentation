    ----------

         Ground truth mask that consists of 2 unique values: 0 - denotes background,
         1 - denotes object.
    pred : np.ndarray, 2d

        Dice score. The greater the value of dice score the better.
    Notes
    -----
    Masks should contains only 2 unique values, one of them must be 0, another value, that denotes
